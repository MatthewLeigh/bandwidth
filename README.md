# Bandwidth (Beta)
Bandwidth was developed as a custom project for Task 6.2D and 6.3HD in unit COS30043. The website is a passion project that I have been wanting to create for a while to address the lack of a decent gig guide for the Melbourne music scene. The website offers information on upcoming events, local venues, and all artists who have performed at a listed event in Melbourne. User's don't need to register to use the site, but those who do are able to save events, add favourite artists and venues for improved filtering of events, and even leave comments throuhgout the site.

The website hosted on GitHub pages and can be viewed at [matthewleigh.github.io/bandwidth](https://matthewleigh.github.io/bandwidth/).

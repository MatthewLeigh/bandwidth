        "The Gasometer Hotel isn't just one of Melbourne’s best-loved pubs. It’s also a crucial, bluestone pillar of the city’s live music scene, with a diverse weekly program of acts. Whether it’s rock, folk, indie or electronic, you’ll see and hear it at the Gaso.

        Most of the action happens in the downstairs band room, a two-storey venue with room for 350 punters across the mezzanine and dance floor. Fitted with a state-of-the-art L’Acousics ARCS
        sound system, it's one of the city's best sounding rooms of its size.

        Upstairs is an additional 90-person room, where you can reliably catch some of Melbourne's best upcoming talent in an intimate setting. Upstairs and downstairs are occasionally joined together for infrequent (but memorable) full venue events.

        The welcoming public bar is also a magnet for good times any night of the week, with Mountain Goat and Moondog on tap, and a solid list of cocktails. The pub’s in-house restaurant, Wheat’s End, is also a destination for gluten-free dining. Head here for house-made falafel, pizza, loaded fries and soups before the gig.",

        "The rest of the country has spent the last decade turning classic hotels into generic neon-lit nightmares, but Melbourne has embraced the old-world charm of its locals.

        LIVE MUSIC is a staple of the Retreat, taking place every day of the week except for Mondays. Swing by to hear indie, folk, blues, electronic, punk and everything in between. For the bigger acts, the cover fee sits around $15, but there are a ton of free gigs as well.

        FAMOUS FOR the massive beer garden out back. Spacious and accommodating, the patio makes for the perfect space for after-work drinks with a big group. It’s half covered and half open air, with umbrellas and heaters to ensure you’re feeling just right.

        INFAMOUS FOR the Sunday roast (and roast sandwich), back and better than ever. While pub roasts are pretty standard, this one is like no other, featuring succulent meat with all the fixings and plated beautifully. Expect to leave stuffed.

        The Retreat embodies this throwback aesthetic. Built in 1846, it hasn’t seen a whole lot of change over the last 150 years. Judging by the decor, the Retreat had its last major renovation sometime in the early ’80s. The vinyl chairs and couches in the main bar are certainly vintage classics. The rest of the decor follows a similar line. It’s like taking a step back in time. Maybe The Retreat is stuck in some sort of space/time warp? One that appears to be inhabited by many bars and hotels located north of the city. But even by Melbourne pub standards, it’s old fashioned – and therein lies the appeal.

        If you’re looking for a no-thrills pub to sink a few beers, eat a pub lunch and reminisce about classic Australian soap operas from the 1980s, this is the place. Judging by the amount of folks in the beer garden each weekend, that seems to be a regular plan. It’s not unlike walking onto the set of Kingswood Country/Richmond Hill, et al. Mind you, the music is much better when the live bands set up shop outside.

        In the reviews for The Retreat, someone wrote “if Brunswick was a pub then this is it.” We wholeheartedly agree. It shares the same essence of our favourite suburb – a little rough-and-tumble to look at, but warm and social when you step inside and not at all lacking when it comes to quality.

        For musos, the Sydney Road joint is a lot more than your average pub – it’s a place to show the community what they’ve got. Over the years, the stage has been graced with many a Melbourne legend. The bandroom is loud and high capacity, so it can make for a big night depending on who’s on. Minors are welcome until 10 pm if accompanied by an adult, and for the big kids, DJs keep the party going ‘til 3 am on Fridays and Saturdays.

        The old-school vibe is a big part of the charm, with a pool table on site, fairy lights twinkling through the courtyard, and a disco ball hanging overhead. On the menu, find elevated pub fare that is made to please everyone, from the vegans to the carnivores.

        From the crafty selection of beers to the ever-changing entertainment, we can’t think of anywhere we’d rather sip away the hours on a lazy afternoon.",

        Located on prime real estate, the hotel looks out over Port Phillip Bay and the St Kilda Esplanade, attracting all sorts of local wildlife plus those who float into the area for a spot of vicarious living.

        “As much as you’ve bought The Espy, you’ll never really own it,” said a message passed on from the previous owners of Hotel Esplanade.

        Your favourite band in the Gershwin Room, pre-gig beers in the Star Wars bar, stumbling in from the seaside… everyone has a story to tell about The Espy. 140 years of stories and secrets are hidden in its walls, from budding romances to celebrations, breakups, and makeups. If the walls could talk, they’d tell some unbelievable tales.

        It’s been a home for many years to Melbourne’s colourful characters, from members of the arts community to musicians looking for their first big break, and the philanthropist, Alfred Felton, who lived and died in The Espy.

        Since reopening its doors in 2018, every square centimetre of The Espy is now open for enjoyment, including the fifth level which has never before been open to the public.

        The reimagined Hotel Esplanade is full of music, arts, cocktails, fun and laughter. To put it simply, there is no pub like it.",

        Amber Drift began as a concept act, unable to find another band that truly represented the curious nature of a banana and peanut butter toasted sandwich. The drums, obviously, provide the energy for the band, hence they are represented by the banana. The bass guitar naturally aligns with peanut butter, not only for the nuttiness of the player, but also the distinct flavour that it permeates throughout the heart of the band. The toasted bread, strange in its double-cooked nature, is best represented by a vocalist carrying a rhythm guitar, played at a questionable standard. Finally, though some might think it unnecessary, the sweetener, often a maple syrup, is best represented by a lead guitar, which provides the finishing touches of something which alone lacks sweetness. Ultimately, these representations extended to a point where we just sounded like a normal rock band, so while the allegory remains it is difficult to fully appreciate.',
